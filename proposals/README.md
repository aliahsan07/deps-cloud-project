# Project Proposals

This section encapsulates open calls for major feature development.
These tasks tend to be rather large in scope and require a large amount of changes across the ecosystems.
This process was intentionally broken out of the ticket management process given the design and scope involved.

If you have a minor feature request, feel free to open an issue in the appropriate project.
If you're not sure which project should have the funcationality added, then you may open a ticket in this project and we will move to the appropriate project.

## Submitting a Proposal

In the beginning, a proposal should contain three main components.

1. Definition of Scope
1. Background
1. User Stories

To submit a proposal, make a copy of the [example](example) directory.
All assets (including design work) should be included in the directory.
The directory should be self contained.

### Definition of Scope

This project follows an [Open-Core model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model) of development.
This means that some aspects of the system are free and open to the public, while others are kepty internal and made available through a paid service.
When submitting a proposal, you should call out if the proposal is meant to be a public or private. Note, some private proposals may require changes to the public facing projects.

### Background

Proposals should contain a background section.
The background should provide:

* a high-level summary of the feature
* why it's desired
* why deps.cloud is best suited to solve the problem

This section is intended to help align the feature request to the product at large.

### User Stories

Finally, an initial proposal should contain a set of user stories.
User stories should speak to the desired functionality that needs to be added to the system.
Stories should not be technical in nature and should speak to an end user capability.
More technical requirements will be required upon acceptance of the proposal.

## Designing your Proposal

Once your propsal is accepted, you will be required to design on your proposal.
This includes adding:

1. Technical Requiremments
1. Solution Design
1. Definition of Milestones

### Technical Requirements

Technical requirements should speak to an over all user story.
This can include specific additions / changes to projects and documentation.
If writing a proposal for a private feature, you should call out to changes that are require
If writing a proposal for a private feature, you should call out to any public facing changes.

### Solution Design

The second part is to provide a solution design.
Some solutions may require multiple designs to be submitted.
This approach often works best as it helps reduce the number of iterations through the review phase.

### Definition of Milestones

The last part of your solution design should include a definition of milestones.
These milestones should include an expected time of delivery as well as which user stories will be included in the milestone.
This will help track the progress toward your solution.
