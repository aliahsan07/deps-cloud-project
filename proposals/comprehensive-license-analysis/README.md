# Comprehensive License Analysis

**Project Scope:** Public

## Background

When projects add new dependency, that dependency tends to come along with a license attached to it.
Licenses explain what users can and cannot do with the software.
Given that deps.cloud maintains a graph of project dependencies, we can easily associate a license to a module within the ecosystem.
This feature can companies better understand what licences they may be infringing upon as well as which of their systems are missing licenses.
