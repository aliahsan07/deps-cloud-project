# Dependency Extractor

Dependency extraction is a core component of this system.
Due to the variability of dependency management files, I wanted this system be flexible to support different file types.
As a result, I chose to work with Typescript due to it's ability to be optionally typed.
It provides static analysis where it can while allowing the parsing logic to be more flexible to the problem.
