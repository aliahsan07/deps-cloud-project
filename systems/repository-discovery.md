# Repository Discovery

Repository discovery is the first step in the process of indexing dependencies between libraries.
The Repository Discovery Service (`rds` for short), is responsible for abstracting away sources of repositories.
Out of box, this system integrates with GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket.
It also enables custom integrations through a Generic remote that configured to pull data out of JSON API's.
